  <h1>Help shape the future of fitness tracking</h1>
  <p>We're running a short study to understand how people track their fitness progress — what's working, what's not, and what still feels frustrating.</p>
  <p>Your input will help shape a smarter, more motivating way to measure change over time.</p>
  <p>📝 The survey takes just 2–3 minutes and is completely anonymous (unless you choose to join a follow-up).</p>
  <p class="hide-mobile"><strong>Ready?</strong></p>
